    "## Question 3\n",
    "Interpolating polynomials allow us to estimate values of an unknown function between known data points. For example, consider the data in Table 1, which was taken from Car and Driver magazine1. Five sport utility vehicles were tested for their acceleration: the data reported were the time it took each vehicle to go from 0 to 30 m.p.h., from 0 to 60 m.p.h., and from 0 to 90 m.p.h. For each vehicle, write the third degree interpolating polynomial and use that polynomial to find an estimate for the time it would take the vehicle to accelerate from 0 m.p.h. to 50 m.p.h. Note: to obtain the polynomials, it may be easier to write the data in the form suggested by Table 2.\n",

    "## Question 4\n",
    "In the problem above, consider the total distance each vehicle will travel while it accelerates from 0 to 90 m.p.h. That quantity can be calculated by integrating the velocity function v(t) for the vehicle. There is one small problem to overcome first. In this problem v(t) is measured in miles per hour and t is measured in seconds, so v(t) should be converted to miles per second before proceeding. The velocity function in miles per second is v(t)/3600. The distance traveled by the vehicle would be âˆ«T v(t) 3600dt, where T is the time at which the vehicle reaches 90 m.p.h. The real 0 velocity function v(t) is not known in this case, but interpolating polynomials for v(t) are available which should approximate v(t). Use the interpolating polynomials you generated in the previous exercise to approximate the distance needed for each vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 90 m.p.h."

Question 2 showed that is not always the case. Use MATLAB to plot the interpolating polynomials you generated in Question 3. Do you believe there is a polynomial relationship between elapsed time and the velocity of the vehicles? What evidence do you have to support your conclusion?"
